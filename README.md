POAM-Tracker is an automated risk governance system that transforms vulnerability scan data into prioritized Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&M).

The platform applies SLA logic, risk scoring, and remediation workflows to continuously track security posture and generate audit-ready and executive-level reporting.

Designed to mirror real enterprise security operations, POAM-Tracker demonstrates how modern security programs automate vulnerability management, compliance evidence, and risk reduction.
